## Notes
Dear CRAN maintainers,

In addition to the requested fix of passing implausible day-of-year
to strptime that was submitted recently, 
we take the chance to submit to CRAN a bunch of accumulated minor adjustments of
the REddyProc package as described in the NEWS file.

Could you, please, publish the most recent version of the REddyProc package
on CRAN?

* win_builder: x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit)

## R CMD check results
No warnings, nor errors.
